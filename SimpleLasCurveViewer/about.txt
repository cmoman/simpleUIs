ABOUT Simple LAS Curve Viewer:

Requires:
-Python version 2.7.9
-PyQt4
-pyqtgraph version 0.9.10

To begin, open terminal:
$ python main.py

This will start the GUI.  Then go to File->import las.  This will open a dialog box.  Select an las file.  Double-click on a curve name to view it.

This program was designed to be an interavtive visualization of the various curves in a well log (las file).
It is built using PyQt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI and pyqtgraph (http://pyqtgraph.org/) for the plotting library.

This program was intended to be part of a larger interactive geophysics application.  Time permitting, additional pieces will be added in the future.

Happy coding!
