ABOUT Simple Sum 2 Cosines UI:

Requires:
-Python version 2.7.9
-PyQt4
-pyqtgraph version 0.9.10

This is a simple user interface that displays 2 cosine waves in the form f(t) = cos(2*pi*f*t + phi) where f is the frequency in hertz, phi is the phase angle, and t is a time series from 0 to 1 second with a sample interval of 0.001 seconds (or one millisecond) or equivalently 500 Hz sample rate.

The controls at the bottom of the UI allow the user to change the frequency of the signals displayed and the phase.  
The first 2 sliders are the phase and frequency respectively of the top plot denoted f(t).
The second 2 sliders are the phase and frequency respectively of the middle plot denoted g(t).
The lower plot is the sum of f(t) and g(t).
The reset button will 'reset' the phase and frequency to zero.

To begin, open terminal:
$ python main.py

This will start the GUI.  Play with sliders in the control panel to get a feel for how phase and frequency work and they play a part in the summed waveform.

This program was designed to be an education tool.  Understanding these fundamentals is the basis for Fourier analysis.

It is built using PyQt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI and pyqtgraph (http://pyqtgraph.org/) for the plotting library.
