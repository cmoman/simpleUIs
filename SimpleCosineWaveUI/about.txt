ABOUT Simple Cosine Wave UI:

Requires:
-Python version 2.7.9
-PyQt4
-pyqtgraph version 0.9.10

This is a simple user interface that displays a cosine wave in the form f(t) = cos(2*pi*f*t + phi) where f is the frequency in hertz, phi is the phase angle, and t is a time series from 0 to 2 seconds with a sample interval of 0.001 seconds (or one millisecond) or equivalently 500 Hz sample rate.

The controls at the bottom of the UI allow the user to change the frequency of the signal displayed and the phase.  Note that changing the phase is simply a time shift and this is true for any mono-frequency waveform.  The reset button will 'reset' the phase and frequency to zero.

To begin, open terminal:
$ python main.py

This will start the GUI.  Play with sliders in the control panel to get a feel for how phase and frequency work.

This program was designed to be an education tool for those (mainly geologists) still struggling to understand these two concepts: frequency and phase.  I hope you enjoy it and learn something.

It is built using PyQt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI and pyqtgraph (http://pyqtgraph.org/) for the plotting library.
